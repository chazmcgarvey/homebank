    <h1>Euro minor</h1>

<p>This is an extra feature that might only be useful for countries with Euro (EUR) as major currency. 
It will permit to configure a <em>euro minor</em> change rate and display into this minor currency.</p>



  <div class="rounded content">

<h2>Dynamic display pre-euro currency</h2>
  
  <p>This feature is normally only useful to people resident in the euro
  zone. It will display the amounts (only show on the fly) in the former
  national currency of the country, excluding inflation.</p>

  <p>As this feature is quite flexible, users wishing to display in another
  currency can do so easily.</p>

  <p>Setting up the minor currency properties is done in the <a href=
  "dlg-pref.html#tab7">Preference dialog</a>.</p>

  <p>When the minor currency is activated, a minor toggle menu will appear
  in most windows.</p>
